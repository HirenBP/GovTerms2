Therefore, if a collective input is made, all the blades change equally. The result is that the helicopter increases or decreases its total lift derived from the rotor.
  [table] Complex investigations: Investigations rated at level 1, level 2 or level 3 in accordance with the ATSB’s rating system.

A safety advisory notice is a ‘softer’ output than a safety recommendation and is used for less significant safety issues – when the available evidence is more limited or when the target audience is not a specific organisation.
  [table] Safety factor: An event or condition that increases safety risk – something that increases the likelihood of an occurrence and/or the severity of the adverse consequences associated with an occurrence.
  [table] Safety issues: A safety factor which can reasonably be regarded as having the potential to adversely affect the safety of future operations and: » is a characteristic of an organisation or a system, rather than a characteristic of a specific individual, or » is characteristic of an operational environment at a specific point in time.
  [table] Safety recommendation: ATSB safety recommendations are formal recommendations from the ATSB to an organisation for it to address a specific safety issue.
