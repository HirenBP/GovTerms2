cancer care continuum: A person’s cancer experience and interactions with the health system, from prevention and early detection, initial presentation, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and/or end-of-life care.
cancer control: Cancer control aims to reduce the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of cancer and to improve the quality of life of cancer patients in a defined population, through the systematic implementation of evidence-based interventions for prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and palliative care. Comprehensive cancer control addresses the whole population, while seeking to respond to the needs of the different subgroups at risk.
care pathway: The management and sequence of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period of time, to provide efficient and effective care for patients with similar conditions.
carer: A person who helps someone through an illness or disability such as cancer.
clinical guidelines: Clinical guidelines are a graded set of recommendations to help clinical decision-making or service planning based on best available research. Ideally all clinical guidelines are developed according to international quality criteria. Some clinical guidelines may be based on systematic review of relevant research.
clinical trial: Research conducted with the patient’s permission, which usually involves a comparison of 2 or more treatments or diagnostic methods. The aim is to gain better understanding of the underlying disease process and/or methods to treat it. A clinical trial is conducted with rigorous scientific method for determining the effectiveness of a proposed treatment.
co-design: Co-design brings professionals and end-users together to design new services, resources, and policies. Applied to policy, this means enabling or empowering people affected by a policy issue to contribute to its solution. Co-design with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is fundamental to achieving change across the health system and to achieve better outcomes. Key Principles and Best Practices for co-design in health with First Nations Australians include First Nations leadership, Culturally grounded approach, Respect, Benefit to community, Inclusive partnerships and Transparency and evaluation.
consumer: Consumer is used to refer to a person affected by cancer as a patient, survivor, carer, or family member; or a consumer organisation representing the views of consumers. See also people affected by cancer.
dataset: A complete collection of all observations of particular characteristics about a set of individuals.

governance: The set of responsibilities and practices, policies and procedures, applied by the project or program steering committee. These provide strategic direction, ensure objectives are achieved, manage risks, and use resources responsibly and with accountability.
health outcome: A health-related change due to a preventive or clinical intervention or service. The intervention may be single or multiple, and the outcome may relate to a person, group or population, or be partly or wholly due to the intervention.
industry-independent cancer clinical trials: Clinical trials not funded by industry e.g. pharmaceutical companies. Industry-independent clinical trials may be funded by government, non-government agencies, the not-for-profit sector, or philanthropic organisations.
leukaemia: Cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow and produces large numbers of abnormal blood cells. It can be acute or chronic.
mortality: The death rate, or the number of deaths in a certain group of people in a certain period of time.
Multi-site Collaborative National Cancer Clinical Trials Groups: Networks of institutions and researchers who conduct studies jointly, using identical protocols and pooling their data.
oncology: A branch of medicine that is focused on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.
palliative care: Care that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with a life-threatening illness. Prevention and relief of suffering is provided through early identification and treatment of pain and other problems such as physical, psychosocial and spiritual.
patient-centred: Considers patients’ cultural traditions, their personal preferences and values, their family situations, and their lifestyles. Patient-centred approach makes patients and their families an integral part of the care team who collaborate with health care professionals in making clinical decisions.
prevention: Action to reduce or eliminate the onset, causes, complications or recurrence of disease or ill health, including through health promotion activities. Prevention is the ability to modify certain cancer-causing risk factors to reduce the likelihood of developing cancer.
primary care: Primary care is a sub-component of the broader primary health care system. Primary health care is usually the first contact an individual with a health concern has with the health system. Primary health care covers health care that is not related to a hospital visit, including health promotion, prevention, early intervention, treatment of acute conditions, and chronic condition management. Primary health care services are delivered in settings such as general practices, community health centres, allied health practices, Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services and via technologies such as telehealth and video consultations. Primary health care professionals include general practitioners, nurses, nurse practitioners, allied health professionals, midwives, pharmacists, dentists, and Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Health Workers and Health Practitioners.
protocol: Detailed written instructions about how to complete a specific task. Describes how, when, where and who should be involved in the task. Protocols may refer to a clinical care process or the working relationship between agencies.
proton beam therapy: A therapy where a beam of protons is used to irradiate cancerous tissue. It is a precise type of radiotherapy that results in less damage to healthy tissue.
psychosocial: Concerned with mental, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being, or issues relating to these states. Psychosocial treatment is intended to address psychological, social and some spiritual needs.
quality of life: An individual’s overall appraisal of their situation and subjective sense of wellbeing.

stage: The extent of a cancer and whether the disease has spread from an original site to other parts of the body.
supportive care: Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side effects across the continuum of the cancer journey from diagnosis through treatment to post-treatment care. Supportive care includes rehabilitation, secondary cancer prevention, survivorship and end-of-life care.
telehealth: The use of technology, such as video calls, to provide health care where the patient and clinician are not in the same location.
translation science: The process of turning observations in the laboratory, clinic, and community into interventions that improve the health of individuals and populations.

Entity: Australian Fisheries Management Authority |Extraction Source: paragraph |Number of Terms: 50
Url : https://www.transparency.gov.au/publications/agriculture/australian-fisheries-management-authority/australian-fisheries-management-authority-annual-report-2023-24/references/glossary
Australian Fishing Zone: Under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 , the Australian fishing zone means:
(a): the waters adjacent to Australia within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the coast of Australia, and
(b): the waters adjacent to each external territory within the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the coast of the external Territory
(c): coastal waters of, or waters within the limits of, a State or internal Territory, or
(d): waters that are excepted waters.
Biomass: Total weight of a stock or a component of a stock.
Biomass limit reference point: The point below which the risk to the stock is regarded as unacceptably high.
Bycatch: Species taken incidentally in a fishery where other species are the target, and which are always discarded.
Byproduct: Any part of the catch that is kept or sold by the fisher but is not the target species.
Demersal: Found on or near the sea floor (c.f. Pelagic).
Discard: Any part of the catch returned to the sea, whether dead or alive.
Effort: A measure of the resources used to harvest a fishery’s stocks. The measure of effort appropriate for a fishery depends on the methods used and the management arrangements. Common measures include the number of vessels, the number of hooks set or the number of fishing days.
Electronic monitoring: Electronic monitoring uses sensors and cameras to monitor and record information on fishing activity in a targeted way. Sensor data and video footage is analysed retrospectively to provide information and verify logbooks according to the needs identified for that fishery.
Fisheries Management Act 1991: One of the two main pieces of legislation (along with the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 ) that detail AFMA’s responsibilities and powers.
Fishing concession: A Statutory Fishing Right, or a fishing permit, or a foreign fishing boat licence granted under the provisions of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 .
Fishing permit: A type of fishing concession granted under Section 32 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 to a person, authorising the use of a specified Australian boat by that person, or a person acting on that person’s behalf, for fishing in a specified area of the Australian Fishing Zone or a specified fishery for specified species, using specified equipment.
Fishing season: The period during which a fishery can be accessed by fishers.
Gillnet: Type of passive fishing gear consisting of panels of net held vertically in the water column, in contact with the seabed, such that fish attempting to swim through the net are entangled. The mesh size of the net determines the size range of fish caught, as smaller fish can swim through the meshes and larger fish are not enmeshed.
GoFish: GoFish is AFMA’s online business facility for fishers to submit their applications, view their record of fishing concessions as held by us, keep their contact details up to date, view quota and catch information, receive messages from AFMA, and monitor progress of applications lodged with AFMA.
Harvest strategy: Strategy outlining how the catch in a fishery will be adjusted from year to year depending on the size of stock, the economic or social conditions of the fishery, conditions of other interdependent stocks or species, and uncertainty of biological knowledge. Well-managed fisheries have an unambiguous (explicit and quantitative) harvest strategy that is robust to the unpredictable biological fluctuations to which the stock may be subject.
Incidental catch: Any part of the catch that is not the target species, including bycatch and by-product.
Individual transferable quotas: Individual portions of a total allowable catch – units of quota – that allow the holder to catch that portion of the total allowable catch each season. The weight value of the individual transferable quotas changes in proportion to changes in the total allowable catch set for a species each season. Individual transferable quotas are fully tradeable and can be sold or leased to other fishers.
Key commercial species: A species that is, or has been, specifically targeted and is, or has been, a significant component of a fishery.
Logbook: Official record of catch-and-effort data completed by fishers. In many fisheries, a licence condition makes the return of logbooks mandatory.
Longline: Fishing gear in which short lines (branch lines or droppers) carrying hooks are attached to a longer main line at regular intervals. Pelagic longlines are suspended horizontally at a predetermined depth with the help of surface floats. The main lines can be as long as 100 kilometres and have several thousand hooks. Droppers on demersal longlines (set at the seabed with weights) are usually more closely spaced.
Maximum economic yield: The sustainable catch or effort level for a commercial fishery that allows net economic returns to be maximised. Note that for most practical discount rates and fishing costs maximum economic yield will imply that the equilibrium stock of fish is larger than that associated with maximum sustainable yield. In this sense maximum economic yield is more environmentally conservative than maximum sustainable yield and should in principle help protect the fishery from unfavourable environmental impacts that may diminish the fish population.
Maximum sustainable yield: The maximum average annual catch that can be removed from a stock over an indefinite period under prevailing environmental conditions.
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) box: The area of the Australian Fishing Zone where traditional fishing by Indonesian nationals is permitted.
Nautical mile: A unit of distance derived from the angular measurement of one minute of arc of latitude but standardised by international agreement as 1852 metres.
Net economic returns: A fishery net economic returns over a particular period are equal to fishing revenue less fishing costs.
Non-target species: Species that are unintentionally taken by a fisher or not routinely assessed for fisheries management. See also Bycatch.
Offshore Constitutional Settlement: An agreement between one or more states and the Australian Government giving individual or joint jurisdiction for a particular fishery that is in both coastal waters and the Australian Fishing Zone. When no Offshore Constitutional Settlement agreement has been reached, the fishery remains under the jurisdiction of the state out to three nautical miles, and of the Australian Government from three nautical miles to 200 nautical miles.
Output controls: Restrictions imposed on the quantity of fish that can be taken from a fishery within a specified period of time. This can be by either a competitive total allowable catch or a total allowable catch allocated to participants as individual transferable quotas.
Overfished: A fish stock with a biomass below the biomass limit reference point. ‘Not overfished’ implies that the stock is not below the threshold, and is now used in place of the status classification of ‘fully fished’ or ‘underfished’.
Overfishing: A fish stock that is subject to fishing mortality that exceeds the fishing mortality reference point.
Pelagic fish: Inhabiting surface waters rather than the sea floor: usually applied to free swimming species such as tunas and sharks.
Precautionary principle: A principle asserting that a degree of scientific uncertainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation in situations where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage.
Quota: Amount of catch allocated to a fishery as a whole (total allowable catch) or to an individual fisher or company (individual transferable quota).
Quota management: A method of management based on output controls that allocates the total allowable catch among eligible operators as shares in the annual total allowable catch.
Reference point: An indicator of the level of fishing (or stock size), used as a benchmark for interpreting the results of an assessment.
Statutory Fishing Rights: Rights granted under Section 21 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 . The nature of Statutory Fishing Rights in a fishery is detailed in the plan of management that creates those rights. A Statutory Fishing Right may be a right to use a boat, a unit of fishing gear or a quantity of catch, or other rights as identified in the management plan.
Species: Members of a species of fish that can breed with one another and produce fertile (capable of reproducing) offspring. In this way, a species maintains its ‘separateness’ from other species; for example, the Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna are two distinct tuna species whereas the general term ‘tuna’ includes all tuna species.
Stock: A functionally discrete population of a species that is largely distinct from other populations of the same species. Such a population may be regarded as a separate entity for management or assessment purposes. Some species form a single stock (e.g., Southern Bluefin Tuna) while others form several stocks (e.g., Albacore Tuna in the Pacific Ocean are divided up into separate Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific stocks).
Targeting: Fishing selectively for particular species or sizes of fish.
Target species: The species being actively sought by fishers.
Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority: An authority comprising the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources (Chairperson), the Queensland Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Chair of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The authority is responsible for monitoring the condition of the jointly managed fisheries in the Torres Strait and the formulation of policies and plans for their management.
Total allowable catch: The amount of fish of a particular species that can be taken from a fishery in a prescribed period. Total allowable catches are set for fish species managed either through individual transferable quotas or through competitive total allowable catches.
Uncertain: Status of a fish stock for which there is inadequate or inappropriate information to make a reliable assessment.
Undercatch and overcatch: Undercatch and overcatch provide for ‘carry over’ or ‘carry under’ of an amount of end of season quota between fishing seasons thereby allowing fishers the flexibility to catch a certain amount of fish over or under their quota, and debit or credit this to or from the following season’s quota.
Vessel monitoring system: Electronic device that transmits the identity and location of a vessel.

5G: 5G is the fifth generation of mobile telecommunications. It provides improved connectivity over a wide range of frequencies to mobile phones and other devices on the wireless network. In Australia, 5G will initially use the same radio waves as the fourth generation (4G). In the future, 5G will use radio waves called ‘millimetre waves’, which have a shorter range than the microwaves used in 4G. 5G infrastructure and devices like mobile phones emit radiofrequency and electromagnetic energy, also known as radio waves. ARPANSA sets the safety standards for exposure to radio waves.
anechoic chamber: A specialised room that absorbs electromagnetic waves designed to perform EME measurements, calibrations, and research.
Australian Clinical Dosimetry Service (ACDS): The ACDS is a national independent dosimetry auditing program, provided by ARPANSA, offering quality assurance for radiation oncology facilities and patients.
Australian National Radiation Dose Register (ANRDR): A centralised repository for the radiation dose records of workers as supplied by the employers, maintained by ARPANSA. It is currently limited to those engaged in the uranium mining and milling industry in Australia.
Australian Radiation Incident Register (ARIR): A national database of incidents and events related to radiation of radioactivity. The purpose of the database is to raise awareness on where, how, and why incidents and events occur, and how they can be best prevented.
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT): The Treaty aims to eliminate nuclear weapons by restricting the development and qualitative improvement of new types of nuclear weapons. ARPANSA is responsible for carrying out Australia's radionuclide monitoring obligations under the treaty. Our radionuclide laboratory is used to run daily tests to detect the presence of radioactive particles that are characteristic of a nuclear explosion.
diagnostic reference level (DRL): An indicative measure used to assess whether, in routine conditions, the amount of radiation used is unusually high (or low) for a specified procedure, such as a CT scan. A DRL is not a regulatory limit, it is a benchmark that provides a simple method of identifying situations where an imaging facility is delivering an unusually high patient dose.
dose: A generic term that may mean absorbed dose, equivalent dose or effective dose –depending on context.
electromagnetic energy: Energy that can travel through space in the form of electromagnetic waves. There are many forms of electromagnetic energy, including gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, infrared radiation, microwaves and radiofrequency radiation.
Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS): A peer-review service offered by the IAEA to strengthen and enhance the effectiveness of a national regulatory system in nuclear, radiation, radioactive waste, transport safety and nuclear security.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): The IAEA is the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field. The Agency works with its Member States and multiple partners worldwide to promote the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear technologies.
ionising radiation: Radiation that is capable of causing ionisation – the process by which an electron is given enough energy to break away from an atom. Ionising radiation has enough energy to cause chemical changes by breaking chemical bonds. This effect can cause damage to living tissue. Examples of ionising radiation include X-rays, electrons (beta radiation) and particles (e.g., alpha radiation).
licence: A written authorisation issued to an operator that allows the operator to carry out an operation legally.
linear accelerator: Linear accelerators (linacs) are medical devices used to deliver radiation therapy in highly targeted doses by generating directed radiation beams. These machines are used in hospitals and medical facilities to treat cancers.
National Radioactive Waste Management Facility (NRMWF): The proposed NRWMF will manage waste generated in Australia. It will be designed to permanently dispose of low-level waste and potentially store intermediate-level waste on a temporary basis. The facility will only manage immobilised solid waste. More information can be found at: www.arpansa.gov.au/NRWMF-radioactive-waste .
non-ionising radiation (NIR): Radiation that does not produce ionisation – the process by which an electron is given enough energy to break away from an atom. When these radiations pass through the tissues of the body, they do not have sufficient energy to damage DNA directly. Examples of NIR include static and low frequency electric and magnetic fields, radio waves, visible light, and ultraviolet radiation.
Personal Radiation Monitoring Service (PRMS): The Personal Radiation Monitoring Service (PRMS) monitors potential ionising radiation exposure to workers in fields such as medical, dental, chiropractic, industrial and mining. PRMS provides and assesses monitors that measure Australian workers’ occupational exposure to radiation to ensure that the recommended dose limit is not exceeded.
Primary standard: Primary standards are instruments or artefacts that allow for the determination of a quantity with the highest possible accuracy. ARPANSA maintains four primary standards for the dosimetry of ionising radiation for Australia.
radiation: Electromagnetic waves or quanta, and atomic or sub-atomic particles, propagated through space or through a material medium.
radiofrequency: Part of the electromagnetic spectrum with frequencies in the range 3 khz to 300 ghz.
radiofrequency radiation: Electromagnetic energy in the radiofrequency range.
Talk to a Scientist: ARPANSA's phone and email service that allows members of the public to talk directly to ARPANSA scientists about questions or concerns relating to radiation exposure and protection and nuclear issues.

Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM): A digital service that can be used by individuals and businesses to set up and manage relationships across government online services. RAM allows people to manage who is authorised to act on their behalf online.
Secure Internet Gateway (SIG): Software that provides organisations with cybersecurity protection at the perimeter between their networks and the internet. Designed to prevent cyberattacks, data leaks, advanced threats and other malicious activities.
self-managed super fund (SMSF): A complying superannuation fund with fewer than 5 members, who are individual trustees of the fund.
shadow economy: Economic activity not declared, which may be a result of attempts to avoid tax obligations. Previously known as the ‘black economy’. Also known as the ‘cash economy’ or ‘non-observed economy’.

tax assured: An estimate of the proportion of tax reported that we are highly confident is correct.
tax gap: An estimate of the difference between the amounts the ATO collects and what we would have collected if every taxpayer was fully compliant with tax law.
taxable payments annual report (TPAR): Some businesses and government entities need to report the total payments they make to contractors each year on a taxable payments annual report (or TPAR).
Test Case Litigation Program: Provides financial assistance to taxpayers who are litigating matters that will clarify the tax and superannuation laws we administer. By developing legal precedent, we seek to ensure we are providing the community with clear principles on how to apply the law.
total revenue effects: An estimate of the additional tax revenue resulting from our taxpayer engagement activities. It is a combination of audit yield and wider revenue effects.
transfers: Administered expenses incurred by the ATO, including super guarantee, super co-contributions, and personal and business benefits and subsidies.
wider revenue effects: An estimate of the additional tax revenue arising from our broader suite of activities, which we can defensibly measure and that is not already captured by audit yield.

Granted patents: Once a patent application has been examined and satisfies various patentability criteria, it becomes a granted patent. It remains a granted patent until the end of the patent period (normally 20 years), provided renewal fees are paid.
Indigenous:: Respectfully includes both Aboriginal Peoples and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples. The term First Nations is also used throughout this report in reference to the Minister’s Statement of Expectations and refers to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.
Journal articles: I: ncludes journal articles and other items published as part of a journal (for example, an editorial or book review).
Live patent cases:: A live patent case is where either a patent application or a granted patent exists. It does not include cases that have lapsed, expired or been withdrawn. Applications may include provisional applications, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications and applications pending in Australia or foreign jurisdictions.
Physical Containment level 4 (PC4) laboratories:: Physical Containment level 4 (PC4) laboratories: Laboratories rated at the highest level of containment and the highest designated biosecurity level for working with highly transmissible diseases and viruses for which there is no vaccines or effective treatment.
PCT applications:: International Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications are a ‘temporary’ phase in any international patenting process and have a life span of 18 months. This type of application is very common in major international corporations and is used by CSIRO when it considers its invention may have wide commercial application. In view of the 18-month time span, it is reasonable to approximate that two-thirds of the reported number were filed in the previous 12-month period.
Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR):: This is calculated as the sum of Lost Time Injuries per million hours worked plus Medical Treatment Injuries per million hours worked.
Science excellence:: An assessment of the competitiveness of CSIRO’s research capabilities. It recognises CSIRO’s science (for example, total citations) and excellence (for example, citation rates). It tends to be output-oriented and includes lagging metrics relating to research publication performance (bibliometrics), esteem measures, such as awards, and expert-peer reviews.
Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions:: Greenhouse gas emissions are organised into scopes to avoid double-counting emissions and indicate those that organisations can control (Scope 1) versus those that they can influence (Scope 3). Scope 1 are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the organisation. Scope 2 are emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, or other sources of energy generated upstream from the organisation. Scope 3 are emissions that are a consequence of the operations of an organisation but are not directly owned or controlled by the organisation.
Sponsored students:: Students are deemed to be sponsored if they receive a full or partial scholarship paid from CSIRO funds to pursue a research project leading to a PhD, master’s or honours degree. This excludes our employees, whose study expenses are considered training and development.
Supervised students:: Students are deemed to be supervised if they have a CSIRO staff member appointed officially by the university as a co-supervisor for their research project. Normally, CSIRO staff are joint supervisors in conjunction with a university academic.
Technical reports:: Includes individually authored chapters as well as whole reports that are subject to peer review and are usually publicly released.

Australian Donation and Transplantation Activity Report: The OTA’s annual report released in February that provides the donation and transplantation outcomes.
Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority (OTA): A statutory body established under the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Act 2008 to deliver the DonateLife program. Also known as the Organ and Tissue Authority (OTA), based in Canberra.
Australian and New Zealand Paired Kidney Exchange (ANZKX) Program: A paired kidney donation program between Australia and New Zealand. It aims to increase living donor kidney transplants for patients who are eligible for a kidney transplant and have a living donor who is willing but unable to donate because of an incompatible blood type or tissue type. Incompatible pairs are enrolled in the program and are matched against other incompatible pairs.
Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR): The national register for Australians to record their organ and tissue donation decision.
Best Practice Guideline for Offering Organ and Tissue Donation in Australia: A guideline developed to outline the best practice approach when speaking with families about organ and tissue donation. The guideline includes the goals of family communication, staff roles and responsibilities, timing and elements of the family donation conversation, training requirements and review of practice.
Clinical Guidelines for Organ Transplantation from Deceased Donors: Guidelines developed by the Transplantation Society of Australia and New Zealand that inform eligibility and assessment criteria for organ transplantation, and for allocation of deceased donor organs to waitlisted patients.
Clinical Practice Improvement Program (CPIP): A program providing clinical strategic focus comprised of 7 elements with associated reportable key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are key to achieving best practice organ and tissue donation in the intensive care and emergency department. The CPIP Phase 4 is implemented in all DonateLife hospitals and are fundamental to the work of hospital donation specialists and the DonateLife agencies.
Consent rate: The number of consents as a percentage of all requests made to potential deceased donor families in the hospital.
DonateLife: The Australian Government brand for all initiatives undertaken as part of the DonateLife program to increase organ and tissue donation for transplantation.

Authorised officer: An officer appointed by the Principal Officer of an agency to receive and allocate public interest disclosures.
Coercive powers: Provisions in the Ombudsman Act 1976 (Cth) and Ombudsman Act 1989 (ACT) by which the Ombudsman can require an agency or person to provide the Office with information.
Complaint: Contact with our Office indicating that something is unsatisfactory or unacceptable, in relation to an action by an agency or organisation within our jurisdiction. This includes: • complaints about an Australian Government agency, including the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police • complaints, including disputes, about public or private sector bodies received under any of the following jurisdictions: Postal Industry Ombudsman, Overseas Students Ombudsman, VET Student Loans Ombudsman and Private Health Insurance Ombudsman • complaints about ACT Government agencies (under the ACT Ombudsman jurisdiction, including ACT FOI complaints, ACT PID complaints and complaints about the ACT Integrity Commission) • complaints made about an agency or organisation within our jurisdiction, but where the issue raised is out of our jurisdiction (for example an immigration decision which was made by the Minister personally). We are unable to consider this situation further, but it is still counted as a complaint to our Office.
Contact: Any external contact to our Office. Contacts are made up of complaints, program specific matters and any other enquiries.
Enquiry: Any contact with our Office that is not a complaint or program specific matter. This can include: • a request to the Office (for example, a request from a journalist, a request under the FOI Act for documents we hold, a Public Interest Disclosure about us, or a service delivery complaint made about our own services) • a purported complaint about an agency or organisation which is determined to be out of our jurisdiction based on the organisation being complained about (for example, telecommunications, banking or state government) • other enquiries (for example, how do I make a complaint about Agency X, an enquiry about private health insurance, PID enquiries, enquiries made to the ACT Ombudsman regarding FOI/Reportable Conduct, and complaint handling advice for providers).
Finalised: A contact is finalised when we have finished taking action in response to that contact.
The Office: The Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
The Ombudsman: The person occupying the statutory position of Commonwealth Ombudsman.
Outcome: The end result of a contact to our Office. These can vary depending on the type of contact, and can include: • rectifying the situation for a person (such as restoring a payment, waiving a debt, a different decision, a better explanation from the agency, and an apology) • assistance or advice for a person (such as referral to a more appropriate avenue, a better explanation by us on review rights, advice on how to make a complaint, and an agency considering a matter in a more timely manner) • outcomes which reflect our role as independent and impartial (such as independent assurance that the agency’s decision was lawful and reasonable) • outcomes for the broader community (such as changes to an agency’s policies or practices)
Out of jurisdiction (OOJ): A matter about which the Office has no legal power under the Ombudsman Act 1976 to investigate.
Own Motion Investigation: An investigation conducted on the Ombudsman’s own initiative.
Parliamentary complaints: Complaints to the Office about Commonwealth or ACT Government agencies.
Preliminary inquiry: A short inquiry into an agency for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction or determining whether or not to exercise the discretion not to investigate a complaint.
Preliminary view: An internal Office process whereby issues identified during investigation are explained to the relevant agency and the opportunity to comment provided, before our Office reaches a final view.
Program specific matter: An application, report or other statutory process, which requires processing by our Office, but is not a complaint. This includes: • applications under the ACT FOI Act (review requests, extensions of time, etc) • reports of Defence abuse • PHIO mediations • FOI mediations • notifications under the ACT Reportable Conduct scheme • PIDs, extension requests and notifications.
Public interest disclosure (PID): Unless otherwise stated, this relates to an internal disclosure of wrongdoing which has been reported by a public official to an authorised internal recipient.
Sensitivity: An attribute of a complaint which may relate to the circumstances of the complainant or the content of the complaint.
Serious abuse: ‘Serious abuse’ (within Defence) is defined as sexual abuse, serious physical abuse, and serious bullying and harassment. All reports of abuse are assessed to determine whether the reported abuse meets this definition.
Systemic issue: A systemic issue is likely to affect a class of persons beyond any person who lodged a complaint or raised a concern. Several complaints of the same type or a single complaint may raise a systemic issue, provided that the effect of the issue may clearly extend beyond a single complainant.
Transfer: Action by the Office to enable a complaint made to us to be actioned by another agency in accordance with its usual processes. Transfers may be authorised or required by legislation or occur by administrative agreement between the Office and the relevant agency. These can be contrasted with when we advise the complainant where and how to make a complaint to an agency, but we take no further action.
Vulnerability: An attribute of a complainant which may require particular considerations on our part to ensure equal access to our services.
Within jurisdiction: A contact about a matter the Office may investigate under the Ombudsman Act 1976.
