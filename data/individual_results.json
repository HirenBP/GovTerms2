This is called the clear read between the different documents. Under this principle, the planned performance in the Portfolio Budget Statements is to be provided on the same basis as actual performance in the annual reports covering the same period, to permit a clear read across planning and actual performance reporting documents. Agencies should take this into account in designing their performance reporting arrangements.",
